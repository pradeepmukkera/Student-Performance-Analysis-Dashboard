#  Student Performance Analysis Dashboard

This data analysis project explores patterns in student academic performance based on various factors including study hours, parental education, and test preparation course completion. The dashboard helps educators and administrators identify performance gaps and opportunities for intervention.

##  Project Files

- `student_performance_dashboard.pbix`: Power BI dashboard file
- `StudentsPerformance.xlsx`: Source dataset used for analysis



##  Implementation Details

###  Data Source
- Dataset: [Kaggle â€“ Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
- Contains columns like gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch, test preparation course, and scores in math, reading, and writing.

### Data Preparation
- Cleaned data using Power Query in Power BI.
- Converted categorical columns to readable labels.
- Created calculated columns for average scores, performance bands, and performance gaps.

###  Visualizations Created
- Average scores by gender and parental education level.
- Score distribution histograms.
- Test preparation effect on scores.
- Heatmap of subject correlation.
- Pie chart of students by performance category.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Metrics and KPIs

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Average Score** | Mean of math, reading, and writing scores |
| **Gender Gap** | Difference in average scores between male and female students |
| **Preparation Effectiveness** | Score improvements among students who completed test prep |
| **Top Performers** | % of students scoring above 85% in all subjects |
| **Low Performers** | % of students below passing threshold in 2 or more subjects |

##  Strategic Insights

- Students with completed test prep show 12â€“18% higher average scores.
- Parental education correlates positively with student performance.
- Gender gap exists: females outperform in reading/writing, males slightly better in math.
- Free/reduced lunch correlates with lower performance, suggesting socio-economic impact.
